Hi everyone,

Our next milestone build is available for testing: EPP ${RELEASE_NAME} ${RELEASE_MILESTONE}

TODO say: No special issues to report! or write the issues to bring to the attention of the group when sending the email.

I have been following the steps on https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/labels/endgame - you can see the checkmarks as to what is done.

Download link: https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/downloads/release/${RELEASE_NAME}/${RELEASE_MILESTONE}/

EPP was built with the p2 repositories at:

${SIMREL_REPO} and
https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/packages/${RELEASE_NAME}/${RELEASE_DIR}/
