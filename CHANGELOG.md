# Eclipse Packaging Project Change Log

The Eclipse Packaging Project (EPP) assembles the contents of the quarterly Eclipse Simultaneous Release (SimRel) into products that can be downloaded from the [Eclipse IDE website](https://eclipseide.org).
This document aims to highlight configuration and content changes of the packages provided by EPP in each quarterly release.
For changes in Eclipse projects that contribute to SimRel and are included in the EPP packages, refer to the change log or New and Noteworthy document of the participating projects.
The [Eclipse IDE New & Noteworthy](https://eclipseide.org/release/noteworthy/) page combines all those documents in one place.

## 2023-12

- The Eclipse IDE for Scientific Computing is not longer being published. If you are interested in helping maintain or resurrect this package, and the underlying Parallel Tools Project, please [leave a comment](https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/issues/85). 
- The PDE Spies has been restored to the Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers.

## 2023-09

This change applies the [recommendation](https://eclipse.dev/eclipse/news/4.28/platform.php#slf4j.api-version-2) from Eclipse Platform to support SLF4J version 2.
For implementation details refer to [EPP Issue #27](https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/issues/27).
- With the new Mylyn major version being released the list of features included in packages have been updated to their new names and IDs.
