## EPP Committer and Maintainer Policy

For each EPP package,
there is a commiter who is the package _maintainer_.
The maintainer is expected to participate in overall project discussions and to be involved in making decisions that affect the maintained package.

If someone is a committer on another Eclipse project,
and they state they are interested in contributing and maintaining an EPP package
or, transferring ownership of an existing EPP package,
that history with other Eclipse projects suffices for them to be nominated and voted-in as a committer.
This differs from most other projects where, for good reason, a person must (usually) have a history of contributions to that specific project, not just Eclipse in general.
There still could be reasons an existing committer would note "no" (-1) for a nomination,
for example, "no, I am the current maintainer and I do not agree to this!"
Normally people do not vote "0" just because they have no first hand knowledge of a person's committer history (as they might on other projects),
but vote "+1" if basic criteria are met, to be welcoming and supportive of new people coming in.

Normally, as with most other Eclipse projects,
unless a committer explicitly "resigns" there would be no automatic removal of a committer just because package responsibility is transferred,
except eventually the usual "inactive" reasons would apply.
If someone is no longer responsible for maintaining a package and has not been active on mailing lists, issues, or discussions for a period of roughly six months,
the Project Lead can remove them via Eclipse Portal for "inactivity".
And, of course, committers should explicitly resign, when appropriate, such as when they are changing responsibilities and know they have no interest or time to be involved.
