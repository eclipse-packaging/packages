     <description><![CDATA[
An <a href="https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io">IDE for Embedded C/C++ developers</a>. It includes  managed cross build plug-ins (<b>Arm</b> and <b>RISC-V</b>) and debug plug-ins (SEGGER <b>J-Link</b>, <b>OpenOCD</b>, <b>pyocd</b>, and <b>QEMU</b>), plus a number of templates to create ready to run blinky projects.
<br/>
<br/>
To avoid compatibility issues with pre 6.x plug-ins, it is recommended to <b>create a new workspace</b> with the new version and <b>import the projects</b> there.
